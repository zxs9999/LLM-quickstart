       " 'text': \"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\\\n\\\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\\\n\\\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\\\n\\\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\\\n\\\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\\\n\\\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\\\n\\\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\\\n\\\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\\\n\\\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\\\n\\\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\\\n\\\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\\\n\\\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\\\\n\\\\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\\\\n\\\\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.\"}"

I usually stop at this location as well as Hancocks on the way to it so I can hit two birds with one stone. Every.single.time. I have stopped here no matter the date, time or weather conditions. The cutting table always has a long line as well as the checkout line. Always. So this past weekend when I went there to grab a few last minute items for Halloween I knew going into it there would be a line and grabbed a number BEFORE even looking at Fabrics. Sure enough I had over 20 minutes to peruse fabric before being called, no big deal- it was already anticipated. Check out line was just as long. Get to the counter and my friend and I were together with two different purchases. She called us up and we both went up since we carpooled together and she waved us up anyway. There were only two cashiers and a growing line by this time. \\n\\nThe cashier was an older woman who's name tag stated Lori, I have had her before a few months prior and she was clearly in a bad mood BOTH times. She checked my items out with my friend standing next to me and we informed her it was two separate purchases (no problem)  and when I pulled up a competitor's coupon on my phone (they have taken competitors coupons for at least two years now and even have buttons on the screen as shortcuts for Michaels, Hobby Lobby, Hancock and I couldn't make out the other one or two) She instantly cops an even worse attitude than she already had. Stating if you want to do two separate purchases you have to get back in line. Wasn't a problem just a second ago?? We made it clear up front it was two different purchases (his purchase was only two items and mine was four) it wasn't like we had a full basket or anything. Said ok, they were next in line, but whatever- he goes to get in line again (which by now had considerably grown longer) She angrily scowls and says 'You don't have one of OUR coupons??\\\" I had both theirs and the competitor's I was using (theirs was 30% off and the one I was using was for 40% off an item) and I informed her 'I actually have both pulled up,but the competitor coupon saves me a little bit more money and you guys accept competitors coupons last I knew\\\" She scowled at me saying 'I've got customers waiting and you're trying to use a competitor coupon over and over again' I told her, no- It was two different purchases not several and that my friend had the same coupon pulled up in his phone too so it wasn't just me.  She kept on about 'I don't have time for this, I have customers waiting etc\\\" and finishes checking out all of my whopping four things.  She then mumbles again that I didn't bring their coupon in, crumples the receipt rudely into my small bag and yells NEXT!!!\\nI join my friend in line and she calls the next person up and low and behold, she's using the same coupon from the same competitor. She was only buying a single item and was out the store in a flash. Then, I couldn't believe my eyes--- Miss 'I have customers waiting and don't have time for this' stops checking out. Walks away from her register leaving one young hispanic woman with a curly long ponytail (meant to catch her name but didn't) to check out 15+ people. She walks over by the customer service desk to wear a little stacked wire tray display of socks, gloves and I think hats were (all assorted colors) and then she proceeds to 'arrange' these items.. because CLEARLY that needed to be done right that second. Even the other cashier looked over at her, back down at the items she was ringing up and shook her head. I honestly felt so bad for that particular cashier. After about 10 minutes of her pretending to be busy they had called up two more people to help cashier, a guy to the returns/service booth and another lady to check out. She walked back up just in time for us to be next in line but when she scoffed at it being us the other new cashier cut her off and waved us over as being the first in her line as she just opened. As we were leaving the person next to us and behind us checking out with Lori all had the same coupon too. I honestly was in shock at the whole situation and especially when she walked away from her register to just fiddle with baskets of assorted gloves and socks- which aren't in any particular order, just tossed into the racks- I mean you can't really fold kids gloves and socks! All she did was toss them around even more in an attempt to look busy. Who does that??? When you have a line of paying customers, some with children who are clearly done standing and waiting- do you really think NOW is the time to go fluff a tray of knit gloves? The poor customer service is very true of this store and it's a shame because they have a great selection- however, any jo ann's does so this one isn't special but the lack of caring and rudeness makes it stand out and not in a good way.</td>\n",

When at a farmer's market, I can't help but want to try food that is raised locally. When at a pub, I am always drawn to the most interesting sounding and tasting drink brewed as local as possible. With this in mind, when I visit an independent coffee shop, I either want to try what THEY are known for (or what they want to be known for) and/or I feel like the atmosphere, decor and ambience should be something not offered at another shop or cafe nearby and should definitely be different than what I feel when walking into chain coffee shops and trying their universally accepted beverages. \\n\\nI discovered Coffee Angel because it is next to a few other locally established legends--- Blue Bear, Earthy, and Cuckoo's Bakery. Recently, with a few minutes to spare on our parking, the wife and I decided to stop in and get a hot drink before hitting the road back to Perth. The cafe looks appealing and chic from the outside. However, inside, it looks much like many other cafes, if even a bit worn around the edges. As a lover of all things chai, I decided to try the tempting Honey and Vanilla Chai Latte. As tempting as it sounded, it didn't actually live up to my expectations as it tasted more like honey and vanilla than anything like chai. We had to wait a bit longer as they initially made my wife's drink with milk rather than soya. \\n\\nI have to admit two things. 1) I have only visited Coffee Angel once and 2) I don't like coffee, but have an extraordinary affinity for other hot drinks. Bearing these two things in mind, I'm interested to try Coffee Angel again in the future because of one mediocre experience, which has left me undecided. And I would need to try something other than Honey and Vanilla Chai Latte, as well as sampling one of the baked goodies. But to be honest, considering it's neighbours, I'm not really sure when my next visit will actually be.</td>\n",

I ended up ordering the Tom Kha Chicken Soup and the Yellow Curry, both them were ordered at a 8 (out of 10) for a spice level.\\n\\nThe Tom Kha Chicken soup was pretty large and was enough to feed 2-3 people.  The flavors were wonderful and there was plenty of chicken pieces.  The only thing that was new to me was these funny looking mushrooms that they used,  they had a purple top, but their bottoms and stems were more of a white/beige color.  \\n\\nThe yellow curry was great as well, but there were a few pieces of potatoes that were undercooked.   The slickness of the dish was more on the mild side even tho I ordered it at a very hot level.  This dish was also large enough to share with a friend or two.\\n\\nI took off a couple of stars because the service was pretty bad.  When I walked in, they didn't have any tables available and so they offered to seat me at the bar.  I grabbed one of the smaller tables beside the bar, sat down and within a few minutes I had my menu.  Then it took about another 10-15 minutes before the waiter came by to take my order.  When I was finished with my meal,  they came by took away my dishes and asked if there was anything else,  I said no and they went away.  Expecting to receive my bill, I ended up waiting another 15 mins before they came back with my bill.  So dinner at a place like this should take about 30-40 mins,  it ended up taking over an hour.

Drinks are not that outrageously priced (for a concert venue), which is refreshing these days.\\n\\nIn summer of 2012 I saw Feist outside, and that part of the venue was great as well.

Richard Chen is the chef/owner of Wing Lei located at the fantastically over the top Wynn in Las Vegas. Wing Lei is the only michelin star rated asian themed restaurant in all of North America and is clearly regarded as one of the best Asian restaurant in this country.  This fact makes it all the more noteable that he's chosen to open his second venture in Pittsurgh, and not only Pittsburgh, but s'liberty (The economically challenged East Liberty section of Pittsburgh).  It opened a couple of weeks ago and clearly has benefited from the hype, having very long waits and difficult key reservation times.  A friend and I naively thought we'd take a shot at trying to get in  Friday night.  We stopped in at 730 PM and were told that the earliest table for two wouldn't be until 900 PM.  This was not a big surprise, so we walked across the street to sample some wine in the newly renovated Red Room.  We stopped back a little before 900 PM and were told we still had a small wait, so we thought we would have another drink at the unusually small bar.  I really am surprised or I guess I should say disappointed that the bar area only has about 5 seats and the restaurant overall doesn't have much room for anyone waiting for a table, nevertheles we were able to get a seat.at the bar.  I'm a little embarrassed to admit, but I ordered an espressotini, which was really really good.  After a few minutes we were sat towards the back in a perfectly acceptable table.  The space itself is relatively small with seating for I'd guess about 80-100.  The tables are somewhat close together and the owner definitely prefers a minimilist approach to his restaurant.  The ceilings are extremely high with beautiful huge paper decorations.  I found the service to be quite good given the fact this place just opened.  We had multiple servers which were all attentive and friendly.  The menu is pretty large serving some of the more en vogue meat items such as kurobuta pork and kobe beef.  We started with pot stickers and some type of poached lobster appetizer.  I found the pot stickers to be average.  They were relatively small and underseasoned. I wasn't pleased either with the poached lobster, which was tasteless and served with a very bland sauce.  On my next visit I really want to try some of his soups or other dishes served in a pot.  Others around us were sampling these and the fragrance was awesome.  We ordered some fried rice to go with our entrees.  The fried rice was great, seasoned well and very fresh tasting.  I tried the kurobuta pork, which is to pork what kobe is to beef.  It was amazing!  A vey nice pork chop perfectly seasoned well marbled and a sweet sauce.  One of the best pork chops if not the best I've ever had.  My friend ordered the kung pao chicken, which I think she said was the best she's ever tried.  I sampled and was really impressed with the flavor.  Again, there is a freshness with these dishes and a crispness to the flavor that I am unfortunately unfamiliar with in many asian dishes.  We skipped the desserts, however he had some interesting options.  The executive chef, I think Alex is his name came out to ask about our meal.  It was a really nice touch and the chef seemed genuinely interested in our feedback.  He's actually a british guy ( I think Alex is his name), who for whatever reason chose Verona/Oakmont ( a small suburb where I'm from to settle in for his time in Pittsburgh).  I thought it was cool to have an asian restaurant in Pittsburgh being captained by a guy from the british empire.  I asked about Chef Chen who was there that night.  He said he'll split his time between vegas and Pittsburgh.  I have no doubt this place will deserve four or five stars once they've had a chance to work out some of the kinks on the current menu or if I do a better job of picking my items.  I didn't think the prices were too outrageous, definitely much less than I payed at Wing Lei.  The food/menu currently isn't near as good or as interesting as Wing Lei, but with chef Chen spending half his time here I'm sure this place will also start to receive some of the national acclaim its sister restaurant currently enjoys.  I really hope he expands the bar.  It is clearly not meant as a bar where people can eat and that's a shame for the single businessman who enjoys good food.</td>\n",
